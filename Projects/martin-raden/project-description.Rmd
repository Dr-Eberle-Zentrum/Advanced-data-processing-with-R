# Reproduce this super nice chart!

It is often that you find a chart that you really like but have no idea how to do.
An example might be the following one.


![](Wildlife-comeback-in-Europe-1.png){ width=50% }

Which is shown and detailed on [https://ourworldindata.org](https://ourworldindata.org/europe-mammal-comeback).

The idea of this project is to recreate this plot as close as possible using `ggplot` and the data available in the provided [CSV file](https://ourworldindata.org/uploads/2022/05/Wildlife-comeback-in-Europe-1.png)

Visualization priorities (from high to low are)

- line style with animal name labels
- percent labels at line ends
- time range label at line start
- x-axis marks
- arrow line style
- annotation of brown bear
- text coloring
- relative font sizes
- animal symbols (no idea where to get them ...)

In the end, this is a "semi-boring" project, since it solely focuses on visualization details...
