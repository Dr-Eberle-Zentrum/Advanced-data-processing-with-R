Hello,
I'm Lukas.
Second try.
I don't like PAT's, very much prefer ssh-keys.
also git is weird. trying to use the global user.name, even if in a repo there's one specified locally.
probably i have to create seperate user profiles on the machine


Here I try a subsequent change to see if everything is still on track
