Hi!

Thank you for looking at my project. 
During a psychology course of mine, we have conducted an experiment. 
I don't think we are supposed to


The file is named "cloze_task_results.csv". You will find that dataset in my 
folder on github. 

Our participants were supposed to continue sentences, which were presented to 
them on their laptop screen. 

For example (it was in german):

"Das ist kein Auto, sondern ..."

The number of alternatives to the sentences, given by the participants were collected.

Explanation of the variables:
"Das is kein Auto, sondern" - variable "text"
"Fahrrad" - variable "response" (Fahrrad is an example)
number of times a certain response was typed in - "count" 

My project for you would be:

- tidy the data
- make a power analysis and tell me the reqired number of participants for a power of 80%.
- analyse the data with two 2x2 factor anovas (I think?) (details are to follow) (I can help with the statistical part if you need it)
- ... tba

I know that there are still some infos missing but these will be added with time.
Thank you for your interest! I'm happy if you want to work on this project!

Best,
Dana
