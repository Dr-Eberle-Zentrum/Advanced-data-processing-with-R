# The Chord Diagram


Please have a look at the following chord diagram:

!["Fig.1 Chord Diagram"](chord.jpg)


Please try to create something similar. You can find the (example) data for this project in the "Data" folder.


The data contains a list of projects (P1 to P12). Every P (1-12) number is an own project which has connections to other projects, for example because they use the same sample or the same method of analyzing data.
The table shows only if these projects are linked to each other (1) or if they are not linked (0). 
If they are linked to each other, there should be also a line between these projects in the graphic. The appearance of the line does not matter (and the table does not contain any additional information).

## First suggested steps
First suggested step would be the data rearrangement and searching for a package that creates chord diagrams.
