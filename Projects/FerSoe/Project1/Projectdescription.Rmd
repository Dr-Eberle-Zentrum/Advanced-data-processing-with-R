Please have a look at the following chord diagram:


!["Chord Diagramm"](./Projects/FerSoe/Project1/data/chord.jpg)


`r getwd ()`

```{r}
getwd()
```

Please try to create something similar.
You can find the (example) data for this project in the data folder.

The data contains a list of projects P1 to P12 in a table that shows if these projects are linked to each other (1) or if they are not linked (0).
If they are linked to each other, there should be also a line in the graphic. 

```{r}
data <- read.csv("./Projects/FerSoe/Project1/data/project_data.csv")
```
The separator needs to be put in the code above.
