## Data set

> data from <https://data.rijksmuseum.nl/object-metadata/download/>\
> This Comma Separated Values file (*202020-rma-csv-collection.zip*) provides a simple inventory of objects in the Rijksmuseum collection. It includes the object number and persistent identifier, as well as a single title, type, creator, date and image URL for each object.

## Visualization goals

original data has column names:

```{r raw}
library(tidyverse)
data <- read_csv("rma-csv-collection.csv")
data
# A tibble:593,948 × 6
```

column 3, 4, 5, 6 should be kept meanwhile on inspecting *objectCreationDate[1]* there are many NA values and strings. Due to the original file being too large (over 100MB), the data is filtered via command line code

    $ awk '$6 ~ /-?[0-9]{1,4}/  { print $3, $4, $5, $6}' rma-csv-collection.csv > rma-downsize.csv

current size `1.1M Nov 17 17:15 rma-downsize.csv`

```{r}
data <- read_csv("rma-downsize.csv")
data
```

```{r renamed, cache = TRUE, echo = FALSE}
data <- data %>%
  transmute(
    title = data[[1]],
    type = data[[2]],
    creator = data[[3]],
    year = data[[4]],
  ) 
data
```

to explore the change of the top 7 *type* according to *year*.

```{r type, echo = FALSE}
types <- data %>% group_by(type) %>%
   summarise(count = n()) %>%
   mutate(type = fct_reorder(factor(type), count))
types  # A tibble:2,577 × 2
range(types$count)  # 1 313905
```

reorder the types according to *count*, choose the top 7 (or if the top 7 are too close, choose the 1st, 21st, 41st, .. in the list)

```{r variables}
str(data$year)  # chr [1:667894]
```

*year* contains strings and NA, to clean the data - filter out rows with *year* that is not a number - try keep the x axis continuous, if it doesn't work, then `fct_lump()` it into ranges

the visualization will be something like ![nothing here](sample.png) and hopefully fancier and with annotations staying in the right places
